The support for the following features and functionality in the existing Video Codec SDK(s) 
are planned to be removed in future. 

Hence we request and encourage all users of the SDK to take a note of this.

1. Support for CUvideosource and the associated APIs including cuvidCreateVideoSource,
   cuvidCreateVideoSourceW, cuvidDestroyVideoSource, cuvidSetVideoSourceState,
   cuvidGetVideoSourceState, cuvidGetSourceVideoFormat, 
   cuvidGetSourceAudioFormat will be removed from the decoder API in future
   SDK versions. Please note that the new decode sample applications in the 
   SDK do not use these APIs, but use FFmpeg instead.
2. Support for Video Codec SDK 4.0 and earlier will be removed in the drivers
   releasing around Q4 2018. As a result, any application compiled with Video 
   Codec SDK 4.0 or below header(s) will stop working after those drivers. 
   Hence applications compiled with  Video Codec SDK 4.0 or below header(s) must
   be upgraded to use later header(s).
